Swap Partition
==============

Though installing the Operating System in a Virtual Machine may be the
same as in real machines, carefully planning the swap partition of the
virtual machines will save a lot of disk space. Follow those guidelines.

Swap Volume
-----------

Mark at the creation of the Virtual Machine that swap disk volume. The
desired max size must be declared there. That way a different disk will
be created with that purpose. This volume is different than regular data
disk volumes: it will be created only at the start of the machine and it
will be destroyed at shutdown. Also, this volume won't keep incremental
changes from the base, as data volumes do.

Partitioning
------------

Later on we will address particular considerations for swap space in
different operating systems. By now, keep in mind that the best practice
is to keep a disk volume *only for swap*.

Linux
-----

It is reccommended keep the swapping the less possible. If possible
remove the swap partitions and the swap configuration in ``/etc/fstab``.

Some software on Linux requires some swap to run. If so, set the
*swappiness* to the minimun this way:

.. prompt:: bash

    sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=1

To make this change permanent add it to the file: ``/etc/sysctl.conf``
